I am a Software Engineer and Technical Writer that lives in Nigeria.
I am very passionate about creating more efficient platforms to aid humanity. Also, I love writing technical contents, it helps to sharpen my skills and also be aware of the fact that somebody reads my articles to find a solution to or get started with something.
